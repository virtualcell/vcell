<p><h2>Generated Math</h2></p>
<p>The Virtual Cell automatically converts the biological description defined in a BioModel into a 
	corresponding mathematical system of equations (e.g. ordinary and/or partial differential equations).
	Once an application is created in a biomodel, The Virtual Cell automatically generates the Math Description upon saving a model or running a simulation.
	</p>
<p><ul><li>Choose View - Math Equations</li>
<p>The Equation Viewer displays all the equations generated from the geometric mapping of the
	model. It is displayed in a tree-structured directory so you can view the math description's defined
	constants, functions, volume domains, and membrane domains. 
	</p>
<p>
	Use the name/value radio buttons to display parameters in an equation as a name or as a value.

<li>Choose View - Math Description Language</li>
<p>The Math Description Language view displays the math used in the simulation. A search
	tool is available at the bottom.

<li>Refresh Math</li>
<p>
		The math is not constantly updated as you create your model therefore if you wish to view a current math you
		need to use the "Refresh Math" button.
		</p>
<p></p>
<li>Create Math Model</li>
<p>
		Click on "Create Math Model" button to create a math model by using the math description generated in a biomodel application.
		A new window will be opened to load the newly created math model. In the new window, further changes can be made, which 
		are completely independent of the BioModel application where the math model is created from.
