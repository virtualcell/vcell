	<introduction>
		<para> <bold> Reactions </bold> define the stoichiometry and kinetics of the BioModel. They consist of 
		<def target = "def_species"> species</def> (variables) and kinetic laws for compartment reactions or membrane fluxes.
		<bold>Reactions</bold> act on species within an individual or membrane structure, or between a volume and adjacent membrane.  
		<bold>Membrane Fluxes</bold> occur within membrane structures and act on species of the neighboring volumes.
		(e.g. channels and pumps).</para>
		<para> <bold> Create, view and edit </bold> reactions and membrane fluxes using either the 
		<link target =  "ReactTabView"> tabular</link> or the <link target = "ReactDiagView"> 
		diagrammatic</link> views.  </para>
		<bold>Properties</bold> for reactions and fluxes can be found in the <link target = "PP_Reactions"> Reactions
		 properties pane</link> or <link target ="PP_MemFlux"> Membrane Flux</link> properties pane in the bottom of the window.
