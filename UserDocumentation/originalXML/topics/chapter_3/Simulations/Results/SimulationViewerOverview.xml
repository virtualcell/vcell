	<introduction> 
	Results from simulations are automatically stored on the remote database server. The Results button becomes 
	active once results are available for a newly run simulation or when a previously run simulation is selected. 
	The results may be reviewed immediately by pressing the Results button on the Simulation panel of the Application 
	dialog. This activates the Simulation Results Viewer. The viewer for results differ for non-spatial and spatial 
	models.
