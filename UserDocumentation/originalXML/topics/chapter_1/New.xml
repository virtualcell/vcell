	<introduction> 
	This section describes the <bold>File->New</bold> menu option. The <bold>New</bold> menu option allows the user to create a new VCell document - biomodel, mathmodel or a geometry document.

	Clicking on <bold>File->New</bold> menu option shows another menu popup where the user can choose to create a new <bold>BioModel</bold>, <bold>MathModel</bold> or <bold>Geometry</bold> document. 
	Clicking on any of those options opens a new document of the chosen type. If the user chooses to create a MathModel, further options are provided in the next level of popup menu. 
	There are 4 options to create a MathModel:
	</para>
	<list>
		<item> <bold>Non-spatial</bold> - creates a non-spatial (with Ordinary Differential Equations) MathModel.
		</item>
		<item> 
		<bold>Spatial from database geometry</bold> - creates a spatial MathModel where the spatial geometry is selected from VCell geometries stored in the VCell database (any geometry that belongs to the current user or that is shared by other users).
		<imgReference target = "FileNewMathModelDBGeom.PNG"/>
		</item>
		<item>
		<para>
		<bold>Spatial from new geometry</bold> - creates a spatial MathModel from a new geometry. 
		The image below shows the dialog the user is prompted with to create a new geometry. The geometry can be analytical (1, 2, or 3D); image-based (from VCell database or imported from image file and processed); 
		mesh-based (from STL file); copied from a BioModel application or another MathModel or a saved Geometry from the VCell database; or created from scratch. 
		For further information on creating geometries, refer to the section on <link target = "GeometryOverview">Geometry</link>.
		</para>
		<imgReference target = "FileNewMathModelNewGeom.PNG"/>
		</item>
		<item>
		<para>
		<bold>From BioModel</bold> - creates a MathModel from a BioModel that can be selected from a list of the user's bioModels or those that are shared with the user. 
		Upon selecting the BioModel, a dialog prompts the user to select an application from a list of applications in the BioModel that should be converted to a MathModel. 
		<bold>Note:</bold> Each application has a separate MathModel associated with it.
