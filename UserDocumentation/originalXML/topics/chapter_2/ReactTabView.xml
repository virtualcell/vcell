	<introduction>
	A table of reactions and membrane fluxes can be used to create and edit reactions. 
	</introduction>
	
	<appearance>
	The table shows the reaction, a user defined name for the reaction, the structure where the reaction occurs
	 and the type of kinetic law governing the reaction.  The bottom pane of the window displays a <link target = "PP_Reactions"> Reaction Properties Pane</link>,
	or <link target = "PP_MemFlux"> Membrane Flux property pane</link>, depending on the current selection. 
	</appearance>
	
	<operations>
	<bold>Enter</bold> a new reaction by double clicking "add new" in the table.  In the popup box select the structure
	where the reaction occurs, define a name for the reaction and type the reaction using the format "a+b->c" 
	where a and b, etc. are reactants and c, etc are products. Numbers before a species name are used to indicate 
	stoichiometry.   If a, b, etc have not been defined, they are automatically created as species within the 
	structure where the reaction occurs.
