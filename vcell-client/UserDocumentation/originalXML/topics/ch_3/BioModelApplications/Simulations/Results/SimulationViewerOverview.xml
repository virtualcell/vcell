	<introduction> 
	The <bold>results viewer</bold> button is enabled when a selected simulation has data stored on the remote VCell server.  
	Simulation data are generated when the user presses either the <bold>remote run</bold> or the <bold>quick run</bold> button (see simulation tab figure below).  
	For 'remote run' simulations, data are saved remotely and the 'results viewer' button will become enabled as soon as data is available on the VCell server.  
	Pressing the results viewer button displays data that is continuously updated as the simulation run proceeds on the VCell server.  
	For 'quick run' simulations, data are not saved persistently and the results viewer is displayed automatically once the simulation run has completed on the users local computer.
