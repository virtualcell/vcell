Histogram of Stochastic Simulations: (See also <link target = "SimCompartmentResults">Non-spatial results overview</link>)
For Stochastic Applications, when multiple trials of a stochastic simulation is run 
(See stochastic section of <link target = "numerical_solvers">Numerical Solvers</link>), the results of the final run are displayed as a histogram instead of a plot. The X-axis of the histograms is auto-ranged to the possible values for the variable plotted on the Y-axis. The Y-axis is the calculated distribution of the variable over the range of 
possible values based on the results of the simulation trials. The calculated values for the distributions can be viewed by using the toggle button.
