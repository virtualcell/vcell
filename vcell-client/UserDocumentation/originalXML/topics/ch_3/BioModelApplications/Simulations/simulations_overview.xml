<page title="Simulations Overview">

	
	<introduction>
	Once a MathModel or an 'application' in a BioModel is created at least 1 simulation must be defined to generate numerical results.  You can create, copy, edit, run (local or remote), stop and delete simulations. 
	The simulations panel also shows the running status (% progress,results available) of all simulations.  
	Select a simulation row to 
	display additional information in the properties panel below, 
	launch a data viewer for simulation that have been run 
	and display parameter scan information.
	Model parameters can be changed for each simulation without changing the overall model.  
	Simulation parameter scans can be defined to iterate over a set of model parameters, automatically generating separate results for each combination of parameter values.  
	The panel also contains 'Output Functions' to add user defined data expressions that are displayed when simulation results are shown.
