        <introduction>
            Users who have forgotten their password are still able to recover their account, by providing the username
            and associated email of their old VCell account.

        <operations>
            If the correct combination was input, an email will be sent to the old account's email address, with a link
            to immediately approve the linking of the VCell account to the Auth0 account.
        </operations>

        <comments> Note that if you do not remember both old username and email, you will have to contact VCell Support
        at VCell_Support@uchc.edu</comments>
