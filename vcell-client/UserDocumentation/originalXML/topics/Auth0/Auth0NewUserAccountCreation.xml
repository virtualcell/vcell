        <introduction>
            New users (or those who simply wish to make a fresh new VCell account) simply need to fill out the bottom
            section of the profile page

        <appearance>
            <imgReference target = "ProfileCreateNew.png"/>

        <operations>
            If a message saying "Failed to map new user, please try again", the likely cause is the VCell username
            already exists. Pick a new one and try again.
