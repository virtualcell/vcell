	<introduction>
	A SpringSaLaD application is designed to add spatial details to Sites and Links within a Molecule, and to define and run simulations using the Langevin Solver.
	</introduction>

	<appearance> 
	When using SpringSaLaD Applications, it is important to be aware that:
		<list>
			<item>The Langevin solver can be used with any Rule-based model that obeys the limitations described below.</item>
			<item>The Langevin solver performs a stochastic simulation, so simulation results will vary by run.</item>
			<item>A very strict geometry is required</item>
			<item>The complexity of calculations makes it practical only for a small number of particles</item>
		</list>
		 
	Using a Network-Free application has the following limitations:
	<list>
		<item>The model must have exactly 3 structures, 2 compartments named "Intracellular" and "Extracellular" separated by a "Membrane"</item>
		<item>All the sites require several attribute, like diameter and relative position to one another.</item>
		<item>The reaction rules are strictly categorized and must obey several syntax restrictions.</item>
	</list>
