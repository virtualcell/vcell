The Virtual Cell Software provides 2 environments for defining computational models.  
<bold>BioModels</bold> and <bold>MathModels</bold> allow the user to create models using the tool that best suits their experience.  
A BioModel consists of a model description (<link target = "PhysOverview">Physiology</link>), and one or more <link target = "ApplicationOverview">Applications</link> generated using a graphical interface to define model elements.  
A MathModel is a document defined using the VCell Markup Language (VCML) and is created using VCML 'code'.
<para><bold>BioModel</bold></para>
The <link target = "PhysOverview">BioModel Physiology</link> 
includes what is known about the biological system in terms of cellular structures, species and biochemical reactions. 

Each <link target = "ApplicationOverview">BioModel Application</link> 
allows the user to define the  quantitative conditions needed to define, run and visualize a Virtual Experiment, i.e. numerical simulation.  Thus, an Application includes the <link target = "GeometryOverview">Geometry</link>, the <link target = "SpecificationsOverview">Specifications</link> (species, 
reactions), <link target = "ProtocolsOverview">Protocols</link> (events, electrical mapping), <link target = "simulations_overview">Simulations</link> and <link target = "PEOverview">Parameter Estimation</link> (if applicable).

A single BioModel may have numerous 
Applications, in which geometries and/or parameters have been changed.  Each
Application, in turn can have multiple Simulations, in which different numerical
methods or conditions are used.

MathModels define Virtual Experiments using VCell Markup Language.
