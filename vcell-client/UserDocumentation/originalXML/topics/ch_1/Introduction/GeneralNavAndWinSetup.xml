	<introduction>
		The document view displays the model at a glance, with intuitive tabs and tree structures that allows the user to navigate a Biomodel with ease.  Note that some of the elements described are required for rule-based modeling, which is also available within VCell.

	<para>
	A <link target="TopMenu">top-level menu</link> allows the user to perform various operations on the VCell document, such as save or export a model or share a model for collaborative viewing.
	Four panels within the document window present the user with a canvas to browse, create and maintain a model.
	</para>
	<para>
		Top left is a <bold>Navigation panel (Panel A)</bold> that allows navigation of the currently open model.  Within the tree structure are links to the components of the BioModel Physiology, including:
		<list>
		<item>A <link target="ReactDiagView">Reaction Diagram</link> view</item>
		<item><link target="ReactTabView">Reactions</link> in a tabular view</item>
		<item><link target="PhysStructTabView">Structures</link> (compartments) in a table view</item>
		<item><link target="SpeciesTabView">Species</link> list in a table view</item>
		<item><link target="Molecules">Molecules</link> </item>
		<item><link target="Observables">Observables</link>)</item>
		</list></para>
		<para>
		The Tree Structure also provides links to
		<list>
		<item><link target="ApplicationOverview">Applications</link></item>
		<item><link target="ParametersAndFunctionsOverview">Parameters and Functions</link></item>
		<item><link target="PathwayOverview">Pathway</link> related information</item>
		</list>

		<bold>View items</bold> in the View Panel (panel B, top right panel) by selecting the item in the tree. For example, choosing the "Reaction" item under "Physiology" in the navigator tree will open the table of reactions in the model in the 'View' panel.
		</para>

		<para>
		<bold>View a summary</bold> of the model by selecting the name of the BioMdoel at the top level of the navigation tree in the "Navigation" panel. The summary contains the model's name, owner, last modified date, permissions to view the model (also refer to <link target="Permissions">File -> Permissions</link>), and a brief summary of each of the Applications in the BioModel.
		</para>

		<para>
		A <bold>View Panel (Panel B)</bold> on the top right provides workspace to view and build the Physiology, with 6 tabs corresponding to items under physiology in the tree structure in the Navigation Panel (Panel A).
		<list>
		<item> <link target = "ReactDiagView">Reaction Diagram</link> is used to visualize and create the reaction network within different compartments.  Compartments, species and reactions or fluxes can be added to the BioModel physiology in this workspace. </item>
		<item><link target="ReactTabView">Reactions</link> lists the reactions in a tabular form. The user can also add/delete reactions here.</item>
		<item><bold>Structures</bold> lists the compartments in the model in a table. Compartments can also be added or deleted in this table.</item>
		<item><bold>Species</bold> lists the species of the model in a table.</item>
		<item><bold>Molecules</bold> list the seed species for a rule-based model and depict the possible states for each molecule.</item>
			<item><bold>Observables</bold> list the functions that define groups of molecular states or species that are created in rule-based models.</item>
		</list></para>
		<para>
		A <link target="PropertiesPaneOverview">Properties Pane</link>) Properties panel) on the bottom right of the VCell document window allows the user to view and edit different properties for an object depending on the tab selected.
		<list>
			<item><bold>Object Properties</bold> displays the properties of any entity (<link target="PP_Species">species</link>, <link target="PP_Reactions">reaction</link>, <link target="PP_Structures">structure</link>, <link target="PP_Molecules">molecule</link>) selected in any of the tabs in the "View" panel.</item>
			<item><link target="PP_Annotations">Annotations</link> displays annotations for any entity (species, reaction, structure, molecule) selected in the "View" panel, or the overall Model if selected in the Navigation Panel </item>
			<item><link target="PP_Problems">Problems</link> lists the errors and warnings in the model that has been created. The user is not allowed to save the model if there are any errors. However, the model can be exported as a <link target="Export">VCML file</link> should the user need to exit before fixing an error.</item>
			<item><link target ="PP_VCellDatabaseInfo">Database File Info</link> provides a brief database summary of the selected model in the "Database" panel.</item>
		</list></para>

		<para>A <bold>Database panel (Panel D)</bold> in the bottom left allows the viewer to view/select models from different database sources.
		<list>
		<item><bold>VCell Database</bold> lists models stored in the VCell database and includes 3 subtabs (<bold>BioModels</bold>, <bold>MathModels</bold>, <bold>Geometries</bold>),
		which each display the different VCell document types stored in the VCell database. Refer to the section on <link target="VCellDatabase">VCell Database</link> for further information.</item>
		<item><bold>BMBD</bold> lists models from the <link target="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels/">Biomodels database</link>, a database of annotated published models in SBML, that can be imported into the Virtual Cell.</item>
		<bold>Pathway Commons</bold> lists pathways that can be mined from the <bold>Pathway Commons</bold> database.
		Please refer to sections <link target="PathwayCommonsPanel">Pathway Commons Database</link> and <link target="PathwayOverview">Biological Pathways</link>.
		</list></para>
