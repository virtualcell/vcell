        <introduction>
            When <bold>Login</bold> is selected at first use, the user is redirected to the <bold>AuthO Profile</bold> page to create a user profile and complete creating an Auth0 account. A VCell username is required to access all the functionality of VCell. The VCell username will then be mapped to an Auth0 login account.

        Once a unique VCell Username is applied, a new Auth0 account is created and you are directed to a Success Auth0 profile page.  Simply close the page and return to VCell. A message saying Failed to map new user, please try again will appear if the username provided is already in use. Pick a new one and try again.
