	<introduction> 
	When VCell is launched, a dialog window will pop up, welcoming the user and asking how they would like to proceed
		with login. There are three options:
	<list>
		<item>
			<bold>Login</bold> - Redirect to the default browser of the computer, to authenticate through Auth0.
		</item>
		<item>
			<bold>Guest</bold> - Immediately login as the VCell Guest User, allowing limited access to VCell features.
		</item>
		<item>
			<bold>Skip</bold> - Dismisses the dialog, placing VCell in a "offline" state. Should the user wish to login
			at a future time, it is possible through the `Account` menu.
		</item>
	</list>
		For more information about what happens after clicking <bold>Login</bold>, see <link target="Auth0Overview">Auth0 Overview</link>
