		<link target = "New">New</link>

	  </item>
	  <item>		
		<bold> Close </bold> - closes the currently open document.
	  </item>
	  <item>
		<bold> Save </bold> - saves the current document to database, overwriting the older version. Note that this menu option is disabled for a new document. 
		For saving a new document, refer to <link target = "SaveAs">Save As</link>. 
		Also, when the user modifies a public model or a model that has been shared by another user and tries to save the model, the "Save" option is enabled. 
		Choosing this option brings up a warning dialog that the model does not belong to the current user and it has to be saved as a new model in the current user's account. 
		Clicking <link target = "SaveAs">Save As</link> brings up the "Save As" dialog. <bold>Cancel</bold> cancels the save operation.
