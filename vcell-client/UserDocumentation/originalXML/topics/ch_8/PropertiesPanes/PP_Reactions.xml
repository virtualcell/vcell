  <introduction>
  The reaction Properties pane is used to display and edit properties of a reaction.
  <imgReference target = "PP_Reactions.png"/>
  </introduction>
		
  <appearance>
 The Object Properties for a Reaction shows the Reaction Name,a combobox for Kinetic Type,  and a button to convert the rate law either from molecules per second to micromolar per second or vice versa. A link or text bubble icon next to the reaction name indicates an associated link or text annotation associated with the reaction. Click the icon to navigate to the Annotations Pane. Below is a table of the kinetic terms used to define the reaction rate (J) that includes all terms referred to in the mathematical expression for J or for expressions for other kinetic terms.  Items in brown cannot be edited.

  <operations>
  <bold>Edit the reaction name</bold> using the text field. A name already given to another reaction will be rejected.
 <para><bold>Make reaction reversible</bold> using the checkbox underneath the reaction name. The checkbox is only visible when the appropriate kinetic type is selected.
   </para>
    <para>
    <bold>Select a rate law</bold> using the combobox to select one of a few predefined rate laws 
    (mass action, Michaelis-Menten reversible and irreversible) in concentration per time (micromolar per second if the model uses the default unit structure) or to enter a user-defined rate law, either in micromolar per second or in molecules per second (again, assuming default units).
    </para>
    <para>
    <bold>Convert the rate law</bold> from micromolar per second to molecules per second, or vice versa, using the <bold>Convert to</bold> button. Note that predefined laws are only in micromolar per second, so if they are converted
    to molecules per second, the user-defined kinetic law will automatically be selected, and remain so even if converted back.
    </para>
    <para>
    <bold> Edit Expressions and their units</bold> in the Expression column. An autofill menu will dropdown as you type to easily find already defined parameters and species that can be included in the expression. Species entered in the rate expression will automatically be assigned as catalysts.  
    <list>
    <item>Predefined rate laws, species concentrations and universal constants cannot be edited.</item> 
    <item>Incompatible units will be silently rejected.</item> 
    <item>If references to new terms are added, new rows will automatically be added for these terms.  An expression for each new
    term must be added in the expression column</item> 
    <item>Terms can be set to <def target = "def_Global">global</def> or <def target = "def_Local">local</def> using a 
    checkbox, except for the reaction rate, which is always local.  Species concentrations and universal constants 
    are always global.</item> 
    	</list>
     </para>
  <para><bold>Add or Edit Annotations</bold> for the reaction using the <link target= "PP_Annotations">Annotations</link> tab in the Properties Pane.</para>
  <para>The <link target="PP_Problems">Problems</link>shows warnings and errors in the model.  The Biomodel cannot be saved to the database if Errors indicated, however the model can be exported as a VCML file. </para>
