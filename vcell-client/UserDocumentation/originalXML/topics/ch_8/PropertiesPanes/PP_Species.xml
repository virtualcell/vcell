	<introduction>
	Selecting a species in the <link target = "ReactDiagView">Reaction Diagram</link> or the <link target = "SpeciesTabView">Species</link> will activate the Species Properties pane in the lower right quadrant of the workspace.  Within this pane, the Species Name can be editing, <link target="PathwayOverview">Linked Pathway Object(s)</link> are displayed, and annotations cans be added.    	
<para> For rule-based models, the <bold>Object Properties</bold> tab provides a graphical editor to specify and edit the molecular details of <link target = "SpeciesTabView">Species</link> using drop-down menus. </para>

	<para><bold>Add additional species information</bold>.  When a molecule is added, if additional information is required the species will be highlighted in red and errors may appear in the <link target = "PP_Problems">Problems tab</link>. In the figure shown, three errors were identified. Two errors arise from the fact that two binding sites have unspecified states; one error arises because molecules within the species are not connected with a bond.</para>

	<para><bold>Specify states</bold> for binding sites by mouse right click on state shape and selecting the cognate binding site.  In the figure shown, the number of errors is now one; bounds between molecules are specified connected and 
				only one site has unspecified states.</para>
