	<introduction>
	Selecting a species in the <link target = "ReactDiagView">Reaction Diagram</link> or the <link target = "SpeciesTabView">Species Table</link> will activate the Species Properties pane in the lower right quadrant of the workspace.  Within this pane, the Species Name can be editing, <link target="PathwayOverview">Linked Pathway Object(s)</link> are displayed, and <link target = "PP_Annotations">Annotations</link> cans be added.
<para> For rule-based models, the <bold>Object Properties</bold> tab provides a graphical editor to specify and edit the molecular details of <link target = "SpeciesTabView">Species</link> using drop-down menus. </para>

	<bold>Specify molecular components </bold> for a species by adding molecules previously created in the <link target = "Molecules">Molecules Table</link> as a component of a species in a rule-based model.When multiple molecules are components of a species, the state of the binding sites bonds must be specified.</para>

	<para><bold>Add additional information</bold> about the molecular components in the species.  When a molecule is added, if additional information is required the species will be highlighted in red and errors may appear in the <link target = "PP_Problems">Problems tab</link>. In the figure shown, three errors were identified. Two errors arise from the fact that two binding sites have unspecified states; one error arises because molecules within the species are not connected with a bond.</para>
